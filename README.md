# PEEL (PhysX Edition)
Physics Engine Evaluation Lab

![alt text](peel.jpg?raw=true)

PEEL was a tool designed to evaluate, compare and benchmark physics engines. See PEEL 1.1 Github repo here: https://github.com/Pierre-Terdiman/PEEL

This is PEEL 2.0, dedicated to PhysX.

For now this is mainly a private backup of the code online.

Because the project supports both very old and very new engines, building everything with the same compiler is basically impossible. Some old engines whose source code has never been made public require e.g. Visual Studio 2010, while brand new engines only support Visual Studio 2019 or C++17. I have no good build solution for this project and no time or motivation to investigate. Included here on GitHub are various manually maintained Visual Studio solutions.

This "PhysX edition" currently mostly includes plugins for recent PhysX versions, but also a couple of guests:

- PhysX 4.1.2
- PhysX 5.1.0
- PhysX 5.4.2
- PhysX 5.5.0
- PhysX 5.6.0
- Jolt 5.2.0
- MuJoCo 3.3.2
- Opcode 2.1 (binaries only)

The older PhysX versions are not included so far. Due to the size limits enforced by Github on binary files, the GPU DLLs have been zipped. Just unzip them locally if you need them. You should still be able to run the precompiled binaries on the CPU.
